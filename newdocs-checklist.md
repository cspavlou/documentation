# Titles and Headings

## Semantics
- Create succinct, meaningful, descriptive titles and headings, and place the most important words first.
- Create titles that clearly describe what the page is about for a user who is unfamiliar with the product. E.g., use “Hyperparameter tuning” instead of “Katib.”
- Ensure page titles stand alone as context for the page. E.g., “Submit Kubernetes resources from a Jupyter notebook” instead of “Submit Kubernetes Resources.” This is important for SEO and for readability in search results. It also bulletproofs against introducing a confusing experience if a page is reorganized into a different section for some reason.
- Ensure that each title and heading is unique within a given content set.
- Ensure page titles are the same wherever they are displayed. Do not shorten titles to make them shorter for a table of contents or navigation element.
- Include articles, prepositions, and punctuation as needed for clarity. However, avoid using an article (a, an, or the) as the first word.

## Capitalization
- Use headline-style capitalization for most titles and headings, including article, chapter, table, figure, and example titles, as well as section and procedure headings.
- Use sentence-style capitalization for titles of steps in step files.
